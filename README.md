# pixel-art-editor WIP
Pixel art editor with html canvas. The pixels painted are actually simulated, each pixel drawn on the screen represents a chunk of PIXEL_SIZE*PIXEL_SIZE real pixels.
The default value is 10 so each pixel in the editor corresponds to 100 real pixels. Every operation is done on this big fake pixels.<br/>
Still Work In Progress
